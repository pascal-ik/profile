Please work on the following questions 

Define what is a Broadcast Receiver? 
An android component that responds to system wide broadcast messages.
 
What are the differences between a static and a dynamic broadcast receiever?  
A static broadcast is implemented in the manifest and runs even when the app is closed.
A dynamic receiver is implemented in code using the onRegisterReceive() method and can only run while the app is actively running.

How do you send a broadcast? 
A broadcast can be sent by passing an intent into the sendBroadcast() method

What is an Intent filter?  
An intent filter specifies the types of intents an activity, broadcast receiever or service can respond to.

How do you secure a broadcast receiver?  
By using permissions to ensure that only permitted receievers can get that broadcast.
By using intent filters in the receiever to ensure that only required events are listened for.
