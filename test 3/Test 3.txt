WHAT ARE BROADCAST RECEIVERS? 
A broadcast receiver is an android component that responds to system wide announcements


WHAT ARE STATIC AND DYNAMIC BROADCAST RECEIVER? 
A static broadcast is declared in the app manifest file and works even when the app is closed. A dynamic broadcast
is implemented with code and must be registered with the onRegisterReceiver() method. It does not work when the app is closed.


HOW TO SEND A BROADCAST?
A broadcast is sent as an intent object by using the sendBroadcast() method.
 
HOW TO MAKE SURE OTHER APPS CAN’T LISTEN TO YOUR BROADCASTS? 
By setting permissions on the broadcaster so that only other apps that have that permission can listen to the sent broadcast and
by using intent filters in an app's broadcast receiver to specify what types of broadcast messages the app is going to listen for.

HOW TO CREATE A BROADCAST RECEIVER? EXPLAIN STEP BY STEP. 

HOW TO IDENTIFY A BROADCAST? 

WHAT IS AN INTENT FILTER? 
Is used to describe the capabilities of it's parent object. It specifies the types of intents that an activity, service or broadcast receiver can respont to.

WHAT ARE THE WAYS YOU CAN ADD AN ACTION TO THE INTENT/INTENTFILTER? 
An action can be added to an intent by using the putAction() method() 
An action can be added to an intent filter by specifying the action in an <action> tag within the intent filter.

WHAT ARE SYSTEM BROADCASTS? 
These are broadcast messages originating from the android os.

CAN YOU ADD MULTIPLE ACTION WHILE SENDING A BROADCAST? 
No

CAN YOU ADD MULTIPLE ACTIONS TO THE INTENTFILTER WHILE RECEIVING A BROADCAST? HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THAT? 
Yes, by registering multiple intent filters
 
WHAT ARE SERVICES? 
These are android components that are used to do long running background tasks. They usually do not have a user interface.

DO ALL SERVICES RUN ON THE MAIN THREAD? 
No, Intent services do not run on the main thread.

WHAT ARE THE TYPE OF SERVICES? 
Foreground, Background(Started and Bound) and intent services.

WHAT METHOD EACH OF THE SERVICES NEED TO IMPLEMENT? 
Started services must implement the onStartCommand()
Bound service must implement the onBind() method.

WHAT ARE SERVICES USED FOR? 
For performing long running tasks in the background so as to not obstruct the performance.

DOES EACH SERVICE NEEDS TO BE DECLARED IN THE MANIFEST?
No, only static services

WHAT IS A STARTED SERVICE? WHEN DO WE USE IT?
A started service is a service started by and app component using the startService() command and can run indefintely in the background even after the starting component has been killed
We use these for performing long running tasks that have some level of importance.

WHAT IS A BOUND SERVICE? WHEN DO WE USE IT?
Is a service that allows components to bind to it. it is killed after the last component unbinds from it.
We use this to allow communication between app components and services.
 
WHAT IS A SCHEDULED SERVICE? WHEN DO WE USE IT? 
A type of service that runs based on certain parameters.
Used when we want to perform certain actions based on certain criteria.

WHAT IS A JOBSCHEDULER? WHY DO WE USE IT? 
A jobscheduler is an api for scheduling various jobs that will be executed with in an apps process.
We use it in order to obtain a balance between performace and battery life.

HOW DO WE PERFORM A JOB USING THE JOBSCHEDULER? EXPLAIN IN DETAIL. 
We construct jobinfo objects and pass them to a jobscheduler using schedule() method. Whenever the criteria of the jobs are met the system will execute them using the jobscheduler.

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BOUND SERVICE WHEN YOU UNBIND FROM IT? 
When the last component unbinds from it, it is stopped.

HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE WITH A BOUND SERVICE? HOW MANY WAYS? 
We can use handlers and messengers
The Android Interface Definition Language
Binder

HOW DO WE USE THE BINDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH A BOUND SERVICE? 
We extend the binder class and return an instance of the binder from onBind(). The app component can then use the binder to directly access public methods on the binder/bound service.

WHAT ARE ARGUMENTS WE NEED PASS TO THE BINDSERVICE() 
(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)

WHAT IS A FOREGROUND SERVICE? 
A service that performs an operation that is noticeable to the user.

WHAT IS A FRAGMENT LIFECYCLE? 
This is the different stages that occur from when a fragment is created to when it is destroyed.

WHAT IS AN ACTIVITY LIFECYCLE? 
This is the different stages that occur from when an activity is created to when it is destroyed.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MERGE AND A REBASE? 

WHAT IS A WEB SERVICE? NAME SOME. 
A service that allows communication over the internet using http.
SOAP
REST

WHAT ARE THE VERBS USED IN REST SERVICE? 
put, get, post, delete...

HOW CAN YOU MAKE A REST CALL IN ANDROID WITHOUT THIRD PARTY LIBS? NAME THE CLASSES.
HttpURLConnection 

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MAKE A NETWORK CALL ON THE MAIN THREAD?  
ANR because this is a long operation. Android automatically throws an exception
